The goal is a 'cracked' UI/UX – meticulously crafted, highly polished, and exceptionally executed."

          { "principle": "Good design makes a product understandable", "application": "Clarity rules. Buttons, navigation, case studies should be self-evident. Hover effects, iconography (with tooltips if ambiguous), and CTAs guide, not confuse. No cryptic icons or abstract menu structures." },
          { "principle": "Good design is unobtrusive", "application": "Content is king. UI elements (navigation, modals, cards) support user interaction with content, not draw attention to themselves. Background animations are ambient, not distracting." },
          { "principle": "Good design is honest", "application": "Avoid 'dark UX.' No hidden elements behind unnecessary clicks, no visual tricks. Forms clearly indicate submission status. Modals are non-trapping. Trust-building design." },
          { "principle": "Good design is thorough down to the last detail", "application": "Every interaction feels intentional. Spacing, padding, font weights, icon alignment – nothing default or 'just working.' Polish micro-interactions and transitions. The site feels sharp, well-oiled, and crafted to the pixel ('cracked')." }
