# Personal Portfolio Website - Product Requirements Document

---

## Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a personal portfolio website that serves as a compelling digital presence showcasing expertise in data storytelling, frontend development, and design. The portfolio targets hiring managers, potential collaborators, and industry peers through a carefully crafted experience that embodies the principle of "Less, but better" - inspired by Dieter Rams' design philosophy.

The core value proposition centers on demonstrating technical proficiency and design sensibility through a "cracked" UI/UX - meticulously crafted, highly polished, and exceptionally executed. The site will feature ambient animations, sophisticated theming, and interactive data visualizations while maintaining peak performance and accessibility standards.

**Problem Statement:** Most portfolios either sacrifice performance for visual appeal or present sterile, generic experiences that fail to communicate the creator's unique voice and technical capabilities.

**Solution:** A performance-optimized, visually distinctive portfolio that balances minimalist design with rich interactivity, powered by modern web technologies and a headless CMS for content flexibility.
