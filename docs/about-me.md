Hey — I'm Kaze, a Kigali-based builder shaped by fintech, hydropower, and bee conservation. Each chapter taught me something different about systems, people, and what it takes to make things actually work.
I think in frameworks but move through experiments — from launching ventures to crafting stories that cut through noise, always drawn to messy, ambitious ideas that matter.
This space is where I connect it all. To explore how lessons in one domain unlock insights in another, and to document what happens when curiosity leads the way.
