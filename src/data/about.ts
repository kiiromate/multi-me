  bio: `Hey — I'm Kaze, a Kigali-based builder shaped by fintech, hydropower, and bee conservation. Each chapter taught me something different about systems, people, and what it takes to make things actually work.\nI think in frameworks but move through experiments — from launching ventures to crafting stories that cut through noise, always drawn to messy, ambitious ideas that matter.\nThis space is where I connect it all. To explore how lessons in one domain unlock insights in another, and to document what happens when curiosity leads the way.`
